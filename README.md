# gcadapter-oc-kmod-deck
Convenient desktop file for overclocking the GameCube controller adapter on Steam Deck.

Download the [desktop file]() and run it. After installation your GCC adapter should now be overclocked to 1,000 Hz, and should persist across reboots. That's it!

See my [guide](https://linuxgamingcentral.com/posts/overclock-gc-adapter-on-steam-deck/) for more info.
